#Banana Pancakes - Jack Johnson

Can't you see that it's just rainin'
Ain't no need to go outside

But baby
You hardly even notice
When I try to show you this
Song is meant to keep you
Doin' what you're supposed to
Wakin' up too early
Maybe we could sleep in
Make you banana pancakes
Pretend like its the weekend now
We could pretend it all the time
Can't you see that it's just rainin'
There ain't no need to go outside
Just maybe
Halaka ukulele mama made a baby
Really don't mind the practice
Cause you're my little lady
Lady lady love me
Cause I love to lay here lazy
We could close the curtains
Pretend like there's no world outside
We could pretend it all the time
And can't you see that it's just rainin'
There ain't no need to go outside

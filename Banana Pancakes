Can't you see that it's just rainin'
Ain't no need to go outside

But baby
You hardly even notice
When I try to show you this
Song is meant to keep you
Doin' what you're supposed to
Wakin' up too early
Maybe we could sleep in
Make you banana pancakes
Pretend like its the weekend now
We could pretend it all the time
Can't you see that it's just rainin'
There ain't no need to go outside
